                <h2 class="section-title">Job scams are on the rise</h2>
                <p class="section-content">
                    Job scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate opportunities and fraudulent schemes. Scammers often use realistic-looking job postings and communication tactics to lure unsuspecting job seekers into their traps. These scams can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and emotional distress. ScamScreener is designed to help you identify and avoid these scams, ensuring your job search remains safe and productive.

                <p class="section-content">
                    ScamScreener employs a multi-faceted approach to detect potential job scams, combining rule-based checks, natural language processing (NLP), and a comprehensive scam domain database.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">Rule-based checks</h3>
                    <p class="subsection-content">
                        Our system scans job postings and communications for suspicious keywords and phrases commonly associated with scams, such as requests for upfront payments, promises of guaranteed employment, or vague job descriptions. For example, the presence of terms like "deposit," "processing fee," or "immediate hire" triggers a flag for further investigation.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">NLP model</h3>
                    <p class="subsection-content">
                        We utilize advanced NLP techniques to analyze the language used in job postings and communications. Our model assesses the tone, urgency, and overall sentiment of the text, identifying patterns that are characteristic of scams. For instance, communications that exhibit excessive enthusiasm, pressure to act quickly, or emotional manipulation are flagged as potentially fraudulent.

                        ScamScreener maintains a regularly updated database of known scam domains and websites. When a job posting or communication includes a link, our system checks it against this database. If a match is found, the job is immediately flagged as a potential scam. This database is continuously refined based on user feedback and new scam reports.
